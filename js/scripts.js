As a dynamically typed language, Ruby does not have hard rules on how to build features, and it is very close to spoken languages. You'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods. Furthermore, Ruby is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.

Thus, Python has gained popularity for being a beginner-friendly language, and it has replaced Java as the most popular introductory language at Top U.S. Universities. Being a very high level language, Python reads like English, which takes a lot of syntax-learning stress off coding beginners.
